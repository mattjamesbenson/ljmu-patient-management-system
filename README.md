# ljmu-patient-management-system
UNFINISHED: A web based application created to inspire a hospital in Abu Dhabi about ways in which patient data
and patient appointments can be managed more effectively. Unfortunately the web app itself was not 100% completed,
however documentation was finished off and the web app was presented to the hospital in Abu Dhabi by myself and the rest of the group.
The hospital were able to use our idea as inspiration on how Laravel could be used to manage their data.
